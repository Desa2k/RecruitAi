This XM8 App will allow players to purchase recruited Ai, and deliver them via aircraft para drop.

Recruits can be added, and removed from the team, making it completly customizable. 
Players can select the skill level of the Ai, which will effect the price of the recruits.
The app has a full gui interface with recruit preview pictures, recruit information such as weapons and price, units current selcted to be in the team, and total team cost.
Made by Desa2k.

To install, merge all files in exile.Your_Map. 
If using Infistar XM8 Apps, disregard the xm8 section in config.cpp file in exile.Your_Map, and merge a3_infiSTAR_Exile_customApps folder.
If not using infistar XM8 Apps, disregard a3_infiSTAR_Exile_customApps file, and merge config.cpp in exile.YourMap as is.
The CfgInteractionMenus section in config.cpp in exile.YourMap is optional. This adds a "Remove Bots" option to vehicles. This option will only show for players whom have bots in the target vehile that are in their group. This will not remove players from vehicles. The purpose of this is when a player loses connection and rejoins, they are no longer party leader, and can no longer command the bots. If they had bots in a vehicle when they disconnected, this allows them to remove the bots, so they can store, sell, or use the vehile.
The IDD's to Whitelist in Infistart are 9002,20001,20002,20003,20004,20005,999999
KCM also needs seto to false in infistar. "KCM = "false";		/* Just close ALL CommandingMenus */"
Players will need to Make bindings and / or adjust controls in Arma to command the Ai. "ESC\Configure\Controls\Command\Select Unit 1"
You can control the units via commanding menu Unit 1, Team White
